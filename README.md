# split-decisions

Split Decisions is a puzzle originally devised by George Bredehorn, and currently made almost exclusively by Fred Piscop.  
Please see [his personal website](http://www.split-decisions.us/).

I love Split Decisions puzzles, and would like to create my own. This repository contains all resources that I make that are relevant to Split Decisions puzzles.

For what it's worth, an additional motivator for me designing these puzzles is that I couldn't find a single author of Split Decisions puzzles who emphasized creating puzzles using plain English. Every Split Decisions author I could find seemed to have some preference towards difficult or obscure words. While I greatly appreciate and admire the work of Mr. Piscop and anyone else who designs these lovely puzzles, it's always been a nagging curiosity of mine -- would Split Decisions be more fun if I weren't stuck on a word that I genuinely didn't know? Or, further, would I be able to rely more heavily on logical deduction and general problem-solving if I were confident that I knew all the words? I hope to answer that.

All code here is my own.  
I do not claim the concept of Split Decisions as my own, nor do I generate any income from the contents of this repository.
