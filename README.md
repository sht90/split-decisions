# split-decisions

## Purpose

Split Decisions is easily my favorite word puzzle, and one of my favorite puzzles in general. It was originally devised by George Bredehorn, and currently made almost exclusively by Fred Piscop. Please see [Mr. Piscop's personal website](http://www.split-decisions.us/) for more details about Split Decisions puzzles.

My ultimate goal with this repository is to be able to quickly and easily create my own Split Decisions puzzles -- whether to solve on my own, or to give to my friends.

# Files

## Outdated

I first attempted this project a while ago. I don't want to delete some of my original attempts at Split Decisions, but I would much prefer to start over from a clean slate than to try to fit new solutions into old, disorganized code.

### DisplayBoard.py

Display a printable version of a complete Split Decisions puzzle.

### Merge_txt_files.py

Utility program to write the intersection of two input .txt files to a new .txt file output.

### PopulateBoard.py

Populate a skeleton of a Split Decisions board with words that would form a valid puzzle.

### SplitDecisionsFinder.py

Find all valid Split Decisions word pairs and print them to .txt file

## Miscellaneous

Many programs within this repository process large text files. I've opted to omit the large text files from this repository for now, but this is a list of every large text file that I've used or considered using:
[10,000 most common words in the English Language](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)
[Every word in the English Language](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
[100,000 most common words in the English Language as of 2005](https://gist.github.com/h3xx/1976236)
[Full Oxford Dictionary, including definitions](https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary)

All code inside this repository is my own.
I do not claim the concept of Split Decisions as my own, nor do I generate any income from the contents of this repository.
